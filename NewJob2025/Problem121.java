Kadane's Algorithm
Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum subarray sum in an array of numbers. 
        The algorithm maintains two variables: max_current represents the maximum sum ending at the current position, 
        and max_global represents the maximum subarray sum encountered so far. At each iteration, it updates max_current 
        to include the current element or start a new subarray if the current element is larger than the accumulated sum. 
        The max_global is updated if max_current surpasses its value.
